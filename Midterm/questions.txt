1. What would be the SQL to create this database and table?
SQL stands for structured query language. It is a database languase that can be used to create, query, modify and delete information from a SQL Database

2. What type of software do we need to have running on our computers to run PHP? 
We need an webserver that is capable of interpreting and running PHP. It can be Apache httpd or NGinx. Also, In this example we are using a MySQL database. We can simplify the instalation process by using MAMP.


3. What type of variable must $link be if we’re using it throughout the document?
$link holds the database connects and if we want to make it available throughout the document, it should be a global variable.


4. We’re using a GET request in this situation. In what situations might we choose to use a POST request instead?
In general, we use POST request when there is sensible information in the request. So if we were sending password, POST would be a better choice.



5. What is AJAX and why are we using it?
AJAX stands for asynchronous JavaScript and XML and is a way to make requests to a server from a browser without reloading the webpage.


6. What is an HTTP request?
HTTP Request is a message from a client to a server that follows the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)


7. Where do we tell the client-side code what to do with the response from the server?
We do that using javascript. The function 'onreadystatechange' is used as a callback when the request is finished. From there we can check if request was succesful and use the returned message.


8. Is the AJAX on the server-side or client-side? Is the PHP on the client-side or server-side?
AJAX is client-side. PHP is server-side

11. If you were going to add this application to Github, what would be the steps to do that? Include the commands.
First I would clone into the repository (git clone [URL]). Then add my files to the folder and add them to the repository (git add -A or git add [filename]). Then I would commit and push to the server [git commit -m [message], git push [remote] [branch]]

12. What would be the benefits of using Github?
Github allows you to version your code in a way that is easy to go back to differents commits. Also GitHub allows you to collaborate and share repositories.
