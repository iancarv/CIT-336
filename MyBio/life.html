			<div class="text holder"><p>I was born in 1991, in São Paulo - Brazil's biggest city. Since young I liked to fiddle around computers and I had no problem handling technology.</p>
			<p>I have alwaus liked to create things. When I was 10, I tried to create a revolutionary method to create diamonds out of charcoal - after all, both were made out of carbon. It consisted in crushing charcoal into pieces and leaving it in the freezer. Unfortunately, it did not work out. But, at least, I learn that failure is a natural part of creative process. The most important is I had real fun in the process. That is a lesson I carry to this date.</p>

			<div class="text holder"><p>Besides programming, one of my hobbies is doing magic. I started when I was 14 and I have been practicing since then. I perform for both children and adults, being the former my favorite. </p><p>Couple of years ago, I was volunteer at Santa Catarina’s Child Hospital. A group of magicians and I would go there to perform to children, and parents who were waiting. It was one of the most rewarding experiences I ever had.</p></div>
