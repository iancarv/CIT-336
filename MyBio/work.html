			<div class="text holder"><p>I started working as a programmer in 2011 at Trinity Midia - a startup in education area. The company was only few months old and I had the chance to work in some really interesting projects there.</p><p>During the internship, I created an prototype of augmented reality app for book publishers. When the student pointed the tablet camera to some pictures in the book and interactive 3D model of the object would appear, making learning more effective and fun. Then, Trinity Midia’s owners presented it to a prospective client - FTD - and they decide to develop it for seven of their book. Needless to say, I was hired after this.</p></div>

			<div class="text holder"><p>I had had the chance of working in some really amazing projects in my life. Most of them were mobile applications or games. One of the most exciting project was called “Play and Learn” - a game for children learn English and Spanish using augmented reality.</p><p>The main idea is easy, a question is draw for the player and to answer the kid has to point it the camera to the card with the correct answer. After, we decided to add some layers of difficulty, by making more complex questions while game progressed.</p><p>Our toughest challenge was to implement a peer to peer multiplayer, as the project was multi-platform and player should be able to play against each other through a local network regardless of their device vendor. But it the end, when everyone saw the final result, people were really impressed. This made me really proud.</p></div>
